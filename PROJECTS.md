# Demo Effects Collection

This document provides information about the demo effects featured in the [Demo Effects Collection](https://cunya.github.io/github-landing-page/).

## What are Demo Effects?

Demo effects are visual techniques and animations that were popularized in the demoscene - a computer art subculture focused on producing demos, which are self-contained programs that produce audio-visual presentations. The demoscene emerged in the 1980s and continues today, with artists exploring computer graphics and sound capabilities.
